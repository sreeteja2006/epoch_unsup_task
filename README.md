# Unsupervised Learning Tasks

This project shows how to use different unsupervised learning methods like KMeans, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering. It includes steps like cleaning data, reducing dimensions, clustering, and checking results.

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook task_unsup.ipynb
```

## What's Inside

- Normalizing data
- Reducing dimensions with PCA and t-SNE
- Clustering with KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering
- Checking how good the clusters are
- Showing the clusters with plots
